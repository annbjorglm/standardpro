# Question 5) The requirement ùëò/‚Ñé¬≤ ‚â• 1/2 is quite restrictive, and that's why we have implicit methods. They are a bit more challenging to implement and somewhat computationally heavier, but they avoid such hair-raising conditions on ‚Ñé and ùëò. Implement implicitly.

This method gives room for larger time steps compared to explicit methods.'''
